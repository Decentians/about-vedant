                <p class="text-justify">I am a 13-year-old and I live with my parents in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. 
                  I’m a single child of my parents. I study in class 8th at Sant Mary Convent
                   School. My father is Mr. Alok Nath and he is a reputed doctor. My mother 
                    Mrs. Jyoti Nath and she is also a doctor. I am an adventurous person who
                     likes to take on challenges. My hobby is dancing. I also go to a dancing
                      class after school. My parents are my biggest strength. They always 
                      support me and guide me to take important decisions in life.

                  There have been a number of experiments and achievements in my life. 
                  I always participate in school activities. After my studies, I want to 
                  become a doctor like my parents. However, I already started preparing 
                  for different competitive exams.
                  
                  I’m very punctual and attentive in life. I never get late for school.
                   I always prefer to do my work on time. I'm very good at managing my 
                   time and maintaining discipline in my life. As much as I can, I always 
                   try to help others and solve their problems to the best of my ability.
                    Whenever they need support and assistance, I give them advice and suggestions
                     when they ask for it.

      <p class="text-justify">More people in the world today are educated than ever before. In 1820 only 
        12% of the people in the world could read and write. Today the share is
         reversed: only 17% of the world’s population remains illiterate. Primary school
          enrollment is now almost universal in most countries, with as many girls enrolling as boys.

        Nevertheless, these figures overshadow the impact of persistent inequity.
         Some 63 million children of primary school age were out of school in 2016 and 
         progress on primary school enrollment remains flat. Most impacted are the world’s
          poorest countries, where the lack of basic education is a hard constraint on development.
           In Niger, for example, just 36.5% of 15- to 20-year-olds are literate.

        Oxfam caught the world’s attention in 2014 with the astounding statistic that 
         85 individuals had the same wealth as the 3.8 billion people who make up the
         poorest half of the world’s population. Three years later the number was down to
          43, and in 2018 to just 26. In their annual report to the 2019 World Economic Forum'
           in Davos, Public Good or Private Wealth, Oxfam takes a strong, unequivocal position:
            this spiraling inequity must be checked, and the way to do it is for all governments
             to provide universal health care, education and social protection, free at the point
              of delivery, funded by fair taxation of rich individuals and corporations. Governments
              , says Oxfam, must “Stop supporting privatization of public services.”
        
        “For some time, the view of institutions like the World Bank was that public services should
         be rationed and minimal, and that the private sector is often a better provider. It was argued 
         that individuals should pay for their schools and hospitals, market mechanisms should be used to
          organize services, and that social protection should be very limited and targeted only at the very
